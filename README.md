DEM_shiny_lighting
==================

Shiny App for R plotting hillshade on a digital elevation map.

This Shiny application currently loads the digital elevation map for a selected area (in this case, the Bow Valley / Canmore area in Alberta Canada).
The application calculates the position of the sun based on the specified time, and projects lighting onto the mountains.
